Georges Lema√Ætre first proposed (in 1927) what became the Big Bang theory in what he called his "hypothesis of the primeval atom". Over time, scientists built on his initial ideas of cosmic expansion and that this expansion could be traced back to the cosmic origin -- a starting point for space and time that Lemaitre called "the day without yesterday."
