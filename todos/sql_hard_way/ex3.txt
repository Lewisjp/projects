INSERTING DATA

Explicit style (says what will be inserted):

	INSERT INTO pet (id, name, breed, age, dead)
	    VALUES (0, "Fluffy", "Unicorn", 1000, 0);

NON-EXPLICIT:

	INSERT INTO pet VALUES (1, "Gigantor", "Robot", 1, 1);

Entering multiple values:

	INSERT INTO person (id, first_name, last_name, age)
		VALUES (1, "Bella", "Lewis", 48), (2, "Jeremy", "Lewis", 40), (3, "Aria", "Lewis", 10);

Portability Notes
database vendors tend to add lock-in to their platforms by extending or altering the data types used. They'll subtly make their TEXT columns a little different here, or their DATETIME columns are called TIMESTAMP and take a different format. Watch out for this when you use a different database.
