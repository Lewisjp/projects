Referential Data

INSERT INTO person_pet (person_id, pet_id) VALUES (0,0), (0,1),(1,2),(2,3),(3,4);


Using this table, could a pet be owned by more than one person? 
The person_pet table can have repeating values, so individual relations are on seperate lines.  This allows us to see all the pets associated with an individual person.

Is that logically possible? What about the family dog? Wouldn't everyone in the family technically own it?  An individual has to take account for it, or a new person value reprsenting a family unit could be added, however that degrades the quality of the database.
