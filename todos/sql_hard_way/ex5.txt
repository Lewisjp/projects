READ/ Selecting Data

* is used to select all values 

SELECT * FROM table;
	SELECT * FROM person;
SELECT criteria(column name) FROM table;
	SELECT name, age FROM pet;
SELECT criteria(column name) FROM table WHERE conditional;
	SELECT name, age FROM pet WHERE dead = 0;


Write a query that finds all names of pets older than 10 years.
SELECT name FROM pet WHERE age > 10;

Write a query to find all people younger than you. 
SELECT * FROM person WHERE age < 20;

Do one that's older.
SELECT * FROM person WHERE age > 20;

Write a query that uses more than one test in the WHERE clause using the AND to write it. 
For example, WHERE first_name = "Zed" AND age > 30
SELECT * FROM person WHERE last_name = "Lewis" && age > 20;

Do another query that searches for rows using 3 columns and uses both AND and OR operators.

SELECT * FROM person WHERE first_name = "Jeremy" OR "Bella" && last_name = "Lewis" && age > 20;
#=> Jeremy

SELECT first_name FROM person WHERE (first_name = "Bella" OR "Jeremy") AND (last_name = "Lewis") AND age > 20;
#=> Bella

Portability Notes:
Some databases have additional operators and boolean logic tests, but just stick to the regular ones that you find in most programming languages for now.
