Week 2

	In order to use I/O in Java, you need to import the package comp102x.IO at the beginning of the program. (set up by this course)

		import comp102x.IO;

			IO.output("Will display, but stay on same Line");
			IO.outputln("Will display, and move the next printing position to a new line.");

		System.out.println("Standard output method for Java.");
