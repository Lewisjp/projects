		"Louise and Maggie's wedding was beautiful."  Bella said with a smile to Jeremy.  "I'm happy she kept her pink hair."  The couple had just got home from a fun weekend in Pennsylvania.  They didn't expect what was waiting for them in their fish tank...
	</p>
	
	<p>
		A Fat Betta fish.  "I didn't even know they could get fat."  Jeremy thought fasting was the answer.  Bella found a different solution online, peas.  According to articles, the fish was likely constipated.  A cleanse consisting of a pea diet could help.

			<li>Boil peas till they are soft</li>

	Even on a pea diet, our lazy fat fish just sat around the castle.  Sometimes you gotta get those fins moving.  We bought a <code>Gold Inca Snail</code> to work out the <code>Betta Fish</code> from time to time.
	</p>

	<p>
	And now for Betta Fish logic....
	<pre><code>
		if !<abbr title="Gold Inca Snail Near By">GIS_<wbr>Near_By</abbr>
			sleep()
		else
			swim_away()
		end
	</code></pre>

		I recommend having a tank of at least 3 gallons if you're going to add a snail.  Another bonus is they eat algae and leftovers.
