	After coming up with a design, you're going to want it to come to life.  Unlike a tattoo you can always get another pumpkin, but just like a tat, that modification is hard to change back.
	</div>
	<br><br>Here are the steps to a perfect Jack-o'-Lantern:<br>
		<ol>
		<li>Create an outline of your design</li>
			<ul>
			<li>Pencil is recommended</li>
			</ul>
		<li>Carve along your outline</li>
			<ul>
			<li>Be sure to also make a lid at a 45 degree angle</li>
			<li>Serrated knives work best for sawing through pumpkin skin</li>
			<li>and always have parental supervision of course....</li>
			</ul>
		<li>Empty pumpkin guts into a bowl for later use</li>
		<li>Scrape the guts along the walls with a spoon</li>
		<li>Place a small candle whose flame won't touch the sides in the pumpkin</li>
		<li>Put the lid back on</li>
		</ol>
